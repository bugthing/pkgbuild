Mutt KISS
=========

This `mutt` "Keep It Simple Stupid" package disables built-in fetching and
sending of mails (over POP3/IMAP/SMTP), returning to the true MUA approach.

Instead, try using [offlineimap][1] to fetch and [msmtp][2] to send mail.
Patrick Brisbin has an [awesome tutorial][3] to make the set up easier.
